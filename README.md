# Progression

## A songwriting and improvisation progress software suite.

For modern musicians, the selection of available practice exercises, toolsets,
and methodologies has never been wider. Along with the widespread use of software,
large chord progression datasets, such as iRealBook, have been made readily accessible
through mobile phone applications. However, a common bottleneck in the path to improvement
as a musician lies in the ability to be self analyse the technical nature of our playing. Music and
music preference is inherently bias. While practicing to become objectively more skilled at an instrument,
biases can help focus one's effort in a specific area but this can also lead to ignorance of
certain techniques and ideas. In this regard, third-party instrument improvement tracking and analysis
that offers users a comprehensive platform to **write and save new songs** (chord progressions), **transcribe**
their own performance, and have **useful analytics** about their own playing. All together, the app could 
provide musicians with deeper objective insight on their playing without necessarily having to study with 
a tutor or pay for lessons.

To focus on improvisation, users should be able to transcribe their playing into the application and be able to
**compare transcriptions overtime**. Long term analytical data will likely be a defining feature as musicians will be able
to quantify their progression instead of subjectively "sounding better", ie *more diverse chord use,
ability to play faster, longer phrasing, outlining progressions better*.
